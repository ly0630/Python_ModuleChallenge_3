Module 3 Homework

Summary:
  Module 3 Python homework consisted of two parts, PyBank and PyPoll. Both assignments are saved as "main.py" in their respective folders in this respository. In addition to the .py file, each raw data csv file is saved in the same folder as well as the Resources folder. The reason that the csv file was saved in the same folder as the .py file is because when I attempted to run the main.py code in Visual Studio Code, it could not locate the csv file in the Resources folder. It did however locate the csv file in the same folder as the .py file. I am uncertain as to why I could not get the code to run directed towards the Resources file. My comment is that I created this code on a Mac computer and I have noticed differences between how the code works between a PC and the Mac. The output file for each main.py file will produce a file in the same main folder that the .py file is located in. 
  
My Comment:
I enjoyed working on this assignment and like working on Python code. I have been practicing Python coding on a app called "sololearn" since we began the Python module in Week 3 of class. I needed help on this code and loading csv files and utilized existing code (see References), tutoring, AskBCS and other resources to complete this assignment. I do not have prior experience coding so I expect that I will be challenged for the rest of this class, however when getting code to work it is rewarding.

  Comment: I found several different python codes that approached the layout and order of operations for this assignment differently. I liked this code because it added printing to the     terminal and writing a text file at the end of the code. There were useful commands that we hadn't covered in class that I researched for my code and will use again in the future.

  Comment: I defined a fuction to calculate an average in my code because I wanted to practice using the def function. I think it will want to use the def function more in the future and will practice it.

  Comment: I struggled with successfully running the csv file in my code and needed assistence. This source defines serval different types of csv files.

  Comment: This helped with using the format function to print the text file.

  Comment: This format function was useful to format percentages to the third decimal place.
